# Port-Scanner

Port scanners are used to detect open ports and services running on a network. It is often used by malicious actors to recon an organization before attacking, but it also has ethical uses.

## Use Cases

### Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing
Penetration testers would check for open ports that could be exploited, the services running would then be checked to see if they are outdated and needed patching. They would also validate whether the firewall rules are being enforced or not.

### Network Security Audits
Often used as part of security audits, this helps determine if any unauthorized services are running on internal or external systems. It also helps ensure security policies (such as HIPPA) is being followed.

### Incident Response and Threat Hunting
Security teams would use port scanners to check which ports have been compromised. This involves identifying unexpected open ports and detecting rogue services which could be part of backdoors. They could then map the breached system to contain threats
